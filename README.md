Just stepped out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 It Feeds, and my brain feels like a blender that someone forgot to turn off. Look, I'm not saying it was a masterpiece, but it definitely chewed me up and spat me out like last week's airline peanuts. There’s something about that mix of raw tension and bizarre monster nonsense that left me both amused and mildly nauseated. 

First off, the plot—if you can call it that—wandered around like a cat who'd lost sight of its tail. Half the time I wasn't even sure who to root for. But hey, that's life, isn't it? Confusing as hell. Something about the way the shadows stretched across the screen… it was like they’d hired a failed magician to handle the lighting. Bravo?

And the characters. Oh, boy. One moment they’re cardboard, the next they’re screaming like banshees in heat. But I’ve got to hand it to that dude, whatever his name was, the lead. There was this one scene where he just stared at the thing (no clue what to call it—a giant, angry sock puppet?) and I thought, “Yep, that's the face I make when they announce a flight delay.”

> I couldn't shake the feeling that the monster was basically playing peekaboo with them the whole time. It was almost adorable, really, if you squinted and ignored all the entrails.

But let’s be real, sometimes you need a break from reality, even if it’s with a lopsided horror flick that couldn't scare a squirrel. There’s something comforting in knowing that no matter how bad things get up there in the air, at least I'm not being chased by whatever mushy thing that was. If you're wondering whether you should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or catch it in theaters—flip a coin.

for(int i = 0; i < monster.appearances(); i++) {
    screamLevels[i] += popcorn.spillAmount();
}

There's this scene towards the end where you think maybe, just maybe, they’ll explain why all this was happening, but nope. The   just smirks and walks away like my colleague did when someone asked for a vegan gluten-𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 sandwich five minutes before boarding ended. All in all, a bizarre night out, and somehow, I think I'd sit through it again. Just for the giggles.
